## BrickIndustries ##
An OpenTTD NewGRF

## MISSION STATEMENT: We will make a NewGRF for open TTD that adds a new industry chain for producing Bricks. ##
  They are called Bricks and not bricks. This is because these bricks are special; they are the only kind fit to build universities out of.

"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Brikueis the Wise?"

  "I thought not. It's not a story the Alumni would tell you. It's a RIT legend. Darth Brikueis was a Dark Lord of the C, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the graphics cards to create working code... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from having compiler errors. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others' code from halting, but not himself."
